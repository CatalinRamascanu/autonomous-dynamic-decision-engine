# Autonomous Dynamic Decision Engine

The purpose of the project is to create a dynamic and autonomous decision engine which will be able to execute different decisions or actions based on an input and on certain conditions/rules defined by the user. The engine aims to be agnostic of the processed data interpretation, relying only on the configuration defined by the user. 

The reason for implementing this project is the fact that most rule engines are difficult to customize for your own situations, there is no easy way to define rules and these types of engines are not capable of executing decisions once a rule has been triggered.

## How to Build

$ mvn clean package
